# PHPStorm-VS-Code-settings

## The best matching color and font settings for newest PHPStorm.

__________

Original VS Code colors cannot be replicated in PHPStorm so it's been done manually!

Some of the most important key shortcuts were changed to match common usage in Windows, for example:

- File rename: **F2**
- Close active tab: **CTRL + W**
- Reopen last closed tab: **CTRL + SHIFT + T**
- Go to implementation: **CTRL + R**
- Find usages: **CTRL + E**
- Select next occurrence: **CTRL + D**

Comments Highlighter 2.4.1 is required.

Tested on Windows.

> If you know how to make PHPStorm plugin then go ahead and use this repo and try to finally make the first proper one because current ones are not even close to be called "VS Code plugin".
